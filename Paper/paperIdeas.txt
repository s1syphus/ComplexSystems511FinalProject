	Ideas for paper:

To include:

	1. Strongly connected Components
		- Simple Wikipedia
			- Pros:
				- smaller size == faster analysis
				- should be able to parse in time for paper
			- Cons:
				- Not full wikipedia, doesn't represent knowledge base as well 
		- English Wikipedia
			- Pros:
				- Represents a huge amount of data/information
				- End goal
			- Cons:
				- HUGE! will take a long time to run computations

	2. Bradford-like law for link numbers
		- Should be relatively easy to do with mysql link database
		- Will be a good comparison to the strongly connected components data

		- Simple Wikipedia
		- English Wikipedia

	3. Analyze both SCC and Bradford law analysis
		- End goal trying to find the main "nodes" of wikipedia
		- Compare and contrast
			- Naive idea that the links at the top/bottom of Bradford analysis should related to the main "nodes"



	4. Graphs/Pictures and stuff
		- Do be decided on later

	5. Further plans/extensions
