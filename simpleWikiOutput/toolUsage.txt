How to use the tools starting with *.hgw.xml file created from wikiprep

1. Use the parserUpdated to generate a file that only contains the link information

	Ex: ./parserUpdated <your page here>.hgw.xml > parserOutput

2. Use the sccUpdated to generate a list of the strongly-connected components
from the link information

	Ex: ./sccUpdated parserOutput > sccOutput

3. Use the removeSingleUpdated to remove the strongly-connected components
that only consist of solo nodes (not needed/interesting)
	This step will generate several useful outputs including:
		1. An updated strongly-connected components file that only
contains components consisting of more than node nodes
		2. A list of the size of the strongly-connected components

	Ex: ./removeSingleUpdated sccOutput sccWithoutSingleOutput
sccCountOutput
